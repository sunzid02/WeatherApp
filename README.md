How It Works
Weather Data Flow:
Search Location: The user inputs the name of the location (e.g., Dortmund) in the search bar and clicks the "Get Weather" button.

API Request: The app makes an API call to the Open-Meteo API to fetch the weather data for the specified location (including temperature, wind speed, weather description, and more).

Displaying Results: The weather data is then displayed dynamically in various cards (e.g., temperature, wind speed, weather description).

Error Handling: If an invalid location is entered or there's an issue with fetching the data, an error message is displayed to the user.

App Layout:
The app is designed using a grid layout with responsive behavior. The weather information is displayed in individual cards, each representing different aspects of the weather (e.g., temperature, wind speed). These cards have hover effects and animations for a more interactive experience.

Environment Setup:
Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can verify your installation by running:

bash
Copy
node -v
npm -v
If these commands show version numbers, you're good to go!
